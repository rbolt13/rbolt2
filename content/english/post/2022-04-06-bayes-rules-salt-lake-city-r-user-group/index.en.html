<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> (“pi”) be the proportion of U.S. adults that believe that climate change is real and caused by people. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is some value between 0 and 1.</p>
<div id="exercise-1-specify-a-prior-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 1: Specify a prior model</h3>
<p>The first step in learning about <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is to specify a <strong>prior model</strong> for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> (i.e. prior to collecting any data). Suppose your friend specifies their understanding of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> through the “Beta(2, 20)” model. Plot this Beta model and discuss what it tells you about your friend’s prior understanding. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do they think is the most likely value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>?<br />
</li>
<li>What range of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> values do they think are plausible?</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>proportion between 0 and 1 (not <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>this model, beta-2-20, is right skewed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Q: what is your friend saying is the most likely value of pie?</p>
<p>A: about .12, aka about 12% of people believe in climate change.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>spike of model is best estimate</p></li>
<li><p>looking at range the prior model drops off above .25, so you friend believes under 25% of people believe in climate change.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="exercise-2-check-out-some-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 2: Check out some data</h3>
<p>The second step in learning about <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, the proportion of U.S. adults that believe that climate change is real and caused by people, is to collect data. Your friend surveys 10 people and 6 believe that climate change is real and caused by people. The <strong>likelihood function</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> plots the chance of getting this 6-out-of-10 survey result under different possible <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> values. Based on this plot:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With what values of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> are the 6-out-of-10 results most consistent?</p>
<p>Approx. 60% of people belive in climate change. Shown by our graph spiking at that value.</p></li>
<li><p>For what values of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> would these 6-out-of-10 results be <em>unlikely</em>?</p>
<p>Our data would not be very likely to happen for values below .25 and above .9.</p></li>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The next step after creating a model (beta-2-20) we collect data.</p></li>
<li><p>This plot is showing us what the chance is that we got these survey results under different possible pie values.</p></li>

<div id="exercise-3-build-the-posterior-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 3: Build the posterior model</h3>
<p>In a Bayesian analysis of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, we build a <em>posterior</em> model of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> by combining the prior model of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> with the data (represented through the likelihood function). Plot all 3 components below. Summarize your observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What’s your friend’s posterior understanding of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>?</p>
<p>My friend’s prior understanding of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is not as low as what it was before, but also not as high as what is suggested in the data.</p></li>
<li><p>How does their posterior understanding compare to their prior and likelihood? Thus how does their posterior <em>balance</em> the prior and data?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="432" /></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depends on a lot of factors</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exercise-4-another-friend" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 4: Another friend</h3>
<p>Consider another friend that saw the same 6-out-of-10 polling data but started with a Beta(1, 1) prior model for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_beta(alpha = 1, beta = 1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="432" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Describe the new friend’s understanding of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Compared to the first friend, are they more or less sure about <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think the new friend will have a different posterior model than the first friend? If so, how do you think it will compare?</p></li>
<li><p>Test your intuition. Use <code>plot_beta_binomial()</code> to explore your new friend’s posterior model of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 1, beta = 1, y = 6, n = 10)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="432" /></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>this is a shoulder shrug, uncertain prior model. It could really be anything.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exercise-5-more-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 5: More data</h3>
<p>Your two friends come across more data. In the <code>pulse_of_the_nation</code> survey, 655 of 1000 people believed climate change was real and caused by people:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(&quot;pulse_of_the_nation&quot;)
pulse_of_the_nation %&gt;% 
  count(climate_change)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 × 2
##   climate_change                    n
##   &lt;fct&gt;                         &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Not Real At All                 150
## 2 Real and Caused by People       655
## 3 Real but not Caused by People   195</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>How do you think the additional data will impact your first friend’s posterior understanding of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>? What about the second friend’s?</p></li>
<li><p>Upon seeing the 1000-person survey results, do you think your two friends’ posterior understandings of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> will disagree a lot or a little?</p></li>
<li><p>Test your intuition. Use <code>plot_beta_binomial()</code> to explore both friends’ posterior models of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p></li>
