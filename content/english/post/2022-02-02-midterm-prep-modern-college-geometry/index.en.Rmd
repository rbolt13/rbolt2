Notes consists of logic, Euclid's 5th, Congruence and Length Theorem, Congruence and Angle Theorem, angles and parallel lines, and triangle congruence theorems. 

# Logic 

Conditional Statement: $P\rightarrow Q$

Inverse: $\exists P\Rightarrow \neg Q$

Contrapositve: $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$

Converse: $Q\Rightarrow P$

### Remember: 

- Inverse applies to the conditional statement. 

- Converse applies to the contrapositve. 

- Conditional statement and contrapositive are logically equivalent. Hence why we can prove things by way of contradiction.

- Inverse and converse are logically equivalent 

### Example 

Conditional Statement: If it is cloudy then it is raining. 

Inverse: It could be cloudy and not raining. 

Contrapositive: If it is not raining then it is not cloudy. 

Converse. If it is rainy, then it is cloudy. 

# Euclids 5th 

If straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.

This relates to parallel lines, and helps us make statements about lines transverse to parallel lines. 

### Example 

When proving supplementary angles add to $180^\circ$ we were able to say we were able to use Euclids 5th element to say that the supplementary interior angles added up to $\geq 180^\circ$ because the lines are parallel (and don't intersect). 

# Congruence and Length Theorem 

- $\overline{AB}=\overline{CD}\Leftrightarrow AB=CD$

# Congruence and Angle Theorem 

- $\angle ABC\cong \angle DEF \Leftrightarrow m\angle ABC = m\angle DEF$

# Angles and Parallel Lines

- Vertical Angles are Congruent ([Proved Quiz 1](https://rbolt13.github.io/quiz_1/))

- Alternative Interior Angles are Congruent 

- Supplementary Angles add to 180

- Corresponding Angles are Congruent

# Triangle Congruence Theorems 

- AAS, SSS, SAS, ASA

### Remember 

SSS is the most obvious and intuitive (and obviously not AAA). 

ASA and SAS have one A or one S sandwhiched in the middle. 

AAS not ASS (can't say that in school).
